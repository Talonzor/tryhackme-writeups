# tryhackme-writeups


I am trying to make a Folder per CTF I do, and also add an "article" to the wiki.
The commits should be all the notes i take during the CTF including text output for enumerators / scanners.

I am new at this! so if you have some tips/hints for me to make this more clear, let me know!
