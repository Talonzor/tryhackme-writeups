Warning: OSScan results may be unreliable because we could not find at least 1 open and 1 closed port
Device type: general purpose
Running (JUST GUESSING): Microsoft Windows 2012|2016 (90%), FreeBSD 6.X (85%)
OS CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows_server_2012:r2 cpe:/o:microsoft:windows_server_2016 cpe:/o:freebsd:freebsd:6.2
OS fingerprint not ideal because: Missing a closed TCP port so results incomplete
Aggressive OS guesses: Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 (90%), Microsoft Windows Server 2016 (89%), FreeBSD 6.2-RELEASE (85%)
No exact OS matches for host (test conditions non-ideal).
